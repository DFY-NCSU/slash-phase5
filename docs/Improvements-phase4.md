## Integrated user-based login feature
**Phase 3** : In the phase 3, user login functionality was not available, which made users unable to save thier search.<br>

## Integrated user-based wishlist Feature
**Phase 3** : Phase 3, users had no means to save their preferred search results, necessitating manual searches, reducing the usability of the application. <br>
**Phase 4** : In Phase 4, we introduced the ability for users to save specific search results upon login, enhancing usability by providing easy access through the wishlist feature.<br>

## Updated UI

## Download CSV
**Phase 3** : In Phase 3, the application lacked a feature that allowed users to download a copy of their search results. <br>
**Phase 4** : In phase 4, a new method was implemented to enable users to download their search results in CSV format, enhancing the utility of the application.<br>

## Currency Convertor
**Phase 3** : In Phase 3, the application was constrained to displaying results exclusively in USD, which limited its versatility. <br>
**Phase 4** : In phase 4, we introduced a method that allows users to choose the currency in which they prefer to view the results. This enhances the application's flexibility and usability.<br>

## Database added
**Phase 3** : In Phase 3, the application lacked a database to store or retrieve any user-related information.<br>
**Phase 4** : In phase 4,  we integrated a PostgreSQL database, which enables the login and wishlist functionalities within the application.<br>
